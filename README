BSSE: Beat Saber Song Extractor
BSSE (or Bessie) is designed to install songs from zip files downloaded from bsaber.com into your Beat Saber library

Bessie will read through the zip files in a certain folder and check if they're for a Beat Saber song. If she finds one
then she extracts the zip file to a folder with the same name of the song in Beat Saber's custom levels folder.

So far the program is hardwired to intake and output songs from specific folders.
I am hoping to make these either auto-detected or based on user-input or something of both.
Tweak the directories as necessary to point Bessie in the right direction.
