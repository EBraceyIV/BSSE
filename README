BSSE: Beat Saber Song Extractor
BSSE (or Bessie) is designed to install songs from zip files downloaded from bsaber.com into your Beat Saber library

Bessie will read through the zip files in a certain folder and check if they're for a Beat Saber song. If she finds one
then she extracts the zip file to a folder with the same name of the song in Beat Saber's custom levels folder (or
where ever you choose to put them).

Bessie will open a file dialog to know where to extract songs from and install them too, respectively.
I've ironed out a few interesting kinks that cropped up between song names and making the directories, but some
undiscovered ones may exist. Use Bessie at your own risk.
